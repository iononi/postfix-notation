# Postfix notation
This program simulates a simple calculator. It receives an arithmetic expression given in infix notation
and processes it to get the equivalent postfix notation. After that, the expression is evaluated and the
result is shown. Currently, the program is able to perform operations with one-digit numbers and two-or-more-digit. 
The program is able of printing just the equivalent postfix notation or both postfix notation and the result, as users' choice.
I'm working on getting the equivalent prefix notation given the infix notation of an arithmetic expression. Also, I'm fixing some 
bugs that occur when operations like 12 * 12 or with more than three operands (e.g. (123 * 2) + (6/3) -2) are typed.
